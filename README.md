# C-Swimming-Class-Database
Within C++, I created an object-oriented database system. It is a simulated swimming class registration program where users can add, delete, modify and view all students registered in swimming classes.  Detailed steps guide users through the program. The database was created by using multidimensional arrays, inheritance and pointers.
